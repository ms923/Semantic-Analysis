Changes in RF as compared to SVR

Explanation of the Key Changes:
Random Forest Regressor:

Instead of SVR, I used RandomForestRegressor from sklearn.ensemble. Random Forests are powerful models that can handle non-linear relationships between features and the target variable, which may help improve your performance compared to linear models like SVR.
The model is trained using the sentence similarity scores as the feature and human similarity scores as the target.
Training:

The training process is similar, but now the RandomForestRegressor is used to fit the training data, which helps in capturing more complex patterns than a linear model.
Evaluation:

The same metrics are used: MSE (Mean Squared Error), R-squared (R2), Pearson correlation, and Spearman correlation.
Random Forest is expected to capture more complex relationships, and you may observe improved performance on your test set.
